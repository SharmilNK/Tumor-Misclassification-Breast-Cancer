🩺 Case : Tumor Misclassification – Breast Cancer Dataset

🔍 Scenario
Patient X received a benign classification from an AI tumor diagnostic tool and was not referred for a biopsy. Months later, the tumor was diagnosed as malignant. The model’s output is now under scrutiny.

🟥 Prosecution
Evaluate how the model arrives at this decision using LIME & Anchor. Provide any key medical indicators that might have been overlooked or minimized.

Python Version
Tested on: Python 3.10
